# Comparing American Airlines Travel Disruptions to Their Peers



## Abstract

This study compares flight delays between American Airlines and the aggregation of its peers in the aviation world.  In recent times American Airlines brand customer perception has suffered, something that was acknowledged by their CEO during their 2018 Q4 earnings call. ([Q4 earnings call transcript](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2019/01/26/american-airlines-group-aal-q4-2018-earnings-confe.aspx))

By comparing AA flight departure on time performance to the aviation population at large we hoped to see if the company is underserving its customers by causing excessive travel distruptions.  Though customer satisfaction can be affected by many variables not measured here, it was hypothesized that travel disruption and delay may contribute to the recent drop in brand reputation.  Our analysis showed that between 2018 and 2019 american American delayed  their flights ~2% more often than their peers.

However when delays did occur, they were on average shorter than the aviation population at large.
